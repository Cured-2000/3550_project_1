# 3550_project_1

For this project, you will implement a simple “secure” system in any object-oriented 
programming  language  supported  on  our  Linux  CSE  machines  following  the  Bell-LaPadula 
(BLP)  security  rules  –  simple  security  and  the  *-property  –  in  addition  to  following  strong  
tranquility.  Your  system  will  have  subjects  and  objects.  Each  subject  can  make  a  request  to  
access an object, but first gets checked by a reference monitor. The monitor makes a decision to 
allow or deny by referring to the security levels of the subject as well as the object the subject is 
trying to access.
